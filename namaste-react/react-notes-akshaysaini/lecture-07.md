2.  **How will useEffect behave if you don't add a dependency array?**

    It will get called every time component gets re-rendered.
3.  **What is SPA?**

    SPA is called single-page-application. React is based on SPA.
4.  **What is the Difference between client-side routing and server-side routing?**

    The difference between these two routings is server side needs to keep making requests to the server in order for the application to rerender, but the client side does not need to keep making requests to the server, it just does it once when the application is being loaded into the browser. React-router does the client-side routing for React.
