**Pollyfill:** Sometimes the browser doesn't understand your code it only understands the newer version of your code so your newer code is known as Pollyfill(Babel does this change for us).

Fun fact: We have two package.lock files in the project the second one is in node\_modules which keeps track of all the transitive dependencies of dependencies under node\_modules..&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Tree shaking:**-> removing unwanted code(libraries under libraries), it happened at the time of creating the build and bundler does this.

#### JSX =>React.createElement => Object => HTML(DOM)
{% endhint %}

**JSX**: \<H1>, In the JSX file these tags are not HTML tags this HTML lookalike tags.

**Babel:** babel converts your JSX code to ‚Äúreact.createElement‚Äù code and then later it‚Äôs converted into regular HTML code so that your browser can understand.

**Component composition:** passing components into components.

{% hint style="success" %}
Always Start the Component name with a capital letter, it is not necessary but it's a good practice.
