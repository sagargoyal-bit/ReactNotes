    NO, JSX is mandatory for react, In the end, each JSX element gets converted into **React.CreateElement** form by Babel.
2.  **Is ES6 mandatory for react?**

    No, ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6. It's just a standard of writing javascript, it gives different methods to write javascript.

    React Fiber is a new reconciliation algorithm, and it is still in the beta stage, By using react fiber whenever some state updates in the component then the whole component will not get re-rendered only the effective part will get re-rendered, by this performance will get optimized**.**
9.  **Why do we need Keys in React?**

    we need keys in react to stop unnecessary re-rending for the components whose data is not changed yet.

    &#x20;we can use the index as keys but they should be the last option because it can cause issues in a list of components. when some middle component gets changed, deleted or added.
11. **What are props in react?**

    Props are variables that we pass as a parameter to components to give data to components.
