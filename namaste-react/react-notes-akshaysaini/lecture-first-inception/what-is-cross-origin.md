**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing** ([CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS)) is an [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP)-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any [origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin) (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.
