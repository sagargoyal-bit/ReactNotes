# ðŸ™ƒ Lecture 05

Created structure and created different components for header, body, and footer

**Assignment Questions:**

1.  **What is the difference between Named Export, Default export, and \* as export?**

    They all are used for exporting data but the difference is in importing them.

```
const exports function_name // named export
export default function_name // default export
```

2.  **What is the importance of the Config.js file?**

    The config file is like a common file that has all the common static variables so that we can import them into all the files from one place.
3.  **What are React Hooks?**

    Reacts hooks are the javascript functions. which are used to update DOM and manage data.&#x20;
4.  **why do we need useState hook?**

    useState also gives you a variable that store's the data but the only difference is its value is tracked by React and whenever data gets changes DOM gets re-rendered.
